          Hi my name is Jenny and I am the creator of <b>The Staging Club</b>. I
          have enjoyed a successful career as a nurse and I am a single mum to
          two little terrors! Although I have enjoyed the various roles Iâ€™ve
          worked in within the NHS, over the past few years I have developed a
          keen interest in <b>interior design</b>, specifically focusing on{" "}
          <b>home improvements on a limited budget</b>! This interest has led me
          to complete many home improvement projects, not only in my own homes
          but in my family and friends homes too. I also became obsessed with
          scrolling through Rightmove and seeing so many pictures of houses that
          had wasted potential and where small changes could have added so much
          more value to the property! I have many friends in the property
          business and spending time working alongside these people has taught
          me a lot about investing in property and strategies to add value in
          order to get good returns. After successfully helping many family and
          friends to complete various home projects they soon encouraged me to
          try and expand my skills and that is when The Staging Club was born!
